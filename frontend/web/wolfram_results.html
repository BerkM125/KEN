            <md-block>Boeing's production rates fluctuate, so there isn't a fixed number of planes they make every year. 

However, you can find their latest production numbers on their website.  

**To find this information, go to:**
* **Boeing's official website:** [https://www.boeing.com/](https://www.boeing.com/)
* **Look for the "Investor Relations" section.**
* **Find their latest financial reports.** These will usually include details about production rates.

Keep in mind that Boeing's production is affected by various factors like global demand, supply chains, and manufacturing capacity.
